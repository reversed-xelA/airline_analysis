# Airline Analysis
## Project Overview
Please take a look at the Analytics brief document for the full outline of the project requirements.

## Resources
***Python Version:*** 3.12   
***Packages***  
Data cleaning and analysis: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn   
Modelling: sklearn   

## Data Cleaning
* Removed the few rows with missing data.
* Checked for duplicate entries.
* Created a 'booking month' variable by parsing the month out of the booking date.
* Corrected flight numbers seemingly attributed to the wrong brand.
* Corrected zip codes of improper format.
* Created a metropolitan/regional boolean column based on zip code location.

## EDA
### Profitability
* I first wanted to check if any flights cost our client money.
* I noticed that the QP flight was particularly unprofitable, with 8.9% of these flights running at a loss.

* Analysed which months brought in the most profit across each brand.

* Also discovered which individual flight numbers were generating the most profit.
* The top 4 flight numbers produced 72% of the overall profits.

* I analysed the mean profit and total profit generated by each company.

* Metropolitan customers generated the majority of the profit.
* The difference in metropolitan and regional profits was proportional across brands.
* 75% of total profit is coming from metropolitan sales. Although this number was an estimate given the data and the cross-referencing of sources, this is surprisingly lower than the percentage of urban dwellers in Aus, which is 86%.

* NSW was the most profitable state

* Although the mean ticket price was the same between genders, females generated 55% of overall profits.

* I also analysed the profit across all ages.

### Brand differentiation
* The distribution of customers across brands was similar for gender, age, state of residence, and  passenger region (metropolitan/regional).

### Media spend analysis
* Digital media expenditure appeared to have the greatest correlation after correlating each media expenditure with profit.

* Furthermore, digital media spending was the most important feature in model predictions during random forest modelling.
